# Personal Python Projects

Welcome to my **Personal Python Projects** folder!  

This folder contains a collection of small Python projects Iâ€™ve been working on for practice, learning, and fun. These projects cover a variety of topics, such as:

- Console-based games
- Utility scripts
- Fun experiments
- Learning exercises

Each project is kept in its own subfolder or file with its own purpose and focus.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).  
To run a project, navigate to its folder and run:

```bash
python filename.py
